# Toolchain & Setup — Linux, macOS, Windows

Everything needed to build agent-bridle and to work the **formal-verification
track** (the Ceremony Contract's proof obligations — `docs/spec/
ceremony-contract.md` §6.2). Core contributors need §1 only; the formal track
adds §2.

Package managers assumed: **apt** (Debian/Ubuntu) on Linux, **Homebrew** on
macOS, **Chocolatey** on Windows. Anything not in a manager uses the tool's
official installer script.

**Verified state (2026-07-16):** §1 is exercised on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
Lean `v4.31.0` and the P1 proof project have been exercised on native Windows;
the formal workflow exercises the same build and proof-integrity gate on Linux
and Windows. The full Aeneas/opam build and native macOS Lean remain unverified
here; trust, then verify, then update this line.

## 0. Version pins (read these, don't hardcode)

Versions are pinned by files in the repos — the pin files are the source of
truth; the values below are a snapshot for orientation.

| Component | Pin file | Snapshot value |
|---|---|---|
| Rust (bridle) | `rust-toolchain.toml` (workspace, if present) / stable | stable |
| Rust (Charon) | `charon/rust-toolchain.toml` | `nightly-2026-06-01` + `rustc-dev`, `llvm-tools-preview`, `rust-src` |
| Charon commit (for Aeneas) | `aeneas/charon-pin` | managed by `make setup-charon` |
| Lean | `aeneas/backends/lean/lean-toolchain` | `leanprover/lean4:v4.31.0` (elan auto-fetches) |
| OCaml | Aeneas README | OCaml **5.x** (e.g. `5.3.0`) |

`rustup` and `elan` are version *managers*: they read the pin files and fetch
the right toolchain per directory. Install the managers; never hand-install a
pinned compiler.

## 1. Core toolchain (all contributors)

| Tool | Linux (apt) | macOS (brew) | Windows (choco) |
|---|---|---|---|
| git | `apt install git` | `brew install git` | `choco install git` |
| rustup | `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs \| sh` | `brew install rustup` | `choco install rustup.install` |
| just | `cargo install just` (or `apt install just` on ≥ 23.04) | `brew install just` | `choco install just` |
| cargo-llvm-cov (optional) | `cargo install cargo-llvm-cov` | same | same |

> **Conflict warning (from Charon's own docs, applies generally):** uninstall
> any distro/brew-installed `rust`/`cargo` before using rustup — a stray
> system rust shadows the pinned toolchains in confusing ways. (`brew
> uninstall rust`, `apt remove rustc cargo`.) The brew *`rustup`* formula is
> fine; the brew *`rust`* formula is the hazard.

Then, in the repository:

```sh
just install-hooks   # mandatory — pre-push mirrors CI
just check           # fmt + clippy (-D warnings, both feature configs) + tests
just check-formal    # pinned build plus proof-escape/import-completeness gate
```

`cargo-llvm-cov` is optional: the coverage recipe skips gracefully when it is
absent and enforces the 75% floor when present.

Windows note: `just check-formal` and the direct Rust recipes run from native
PowerShell. Recipes with embedded POSIX scripts (including the full hook) still
require Git Bash, or run everything in WSL2 (Ubuntu) and follow the Linux
column.

## 2. Formal-verification track (Lean · Charon · Aeneas)

The pipeline: **Charon** extracts pinned-nightly Rust to LLBC; **Aeneas**
(OCaml) translates LLBC to **Lean**; proofs live in Lean. You need all three
only to *regenerate or re-prove*; reviewing proofs needs Lean alone.

### 2.1 elan (Lean version manager)

| OS | Install |
|---|---|
| Linux | `curl https://elan.lean-lang.org/elan-init.sh -sSf \| sh` |
| macOS | `brew install elan-init` |
| Windows | PowerShell installer from the [elan releases](https://github.com/leanprover/elan/releases) (no reliable choco package; `scoop install elan` also works) |

No manual Lean install: elan reads `lean-toolchain` files per directory and
fetches the pinned version (first `lake build` in a Lean dir does the fetch).

### 2.2 OCaml + opam (for Aeneas)

| OS | Install opam | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | `apt install opam build-essential pkg-config m4` | then `opam init --auto-setup` and `eval $(opam env)` |
| macOS | `brew install opam` | same init |
| Windows | **Recommended: WSL2**, then the Linux column | opam ≥ 2.2 has native Windows support but the Aeneas dep stack is untested on it here; WSL2 is the supported path |

Create the OCaml 5 switch and install Aeneas's dependencies (list from the
Aeneas README — check it for drift before pasting):

```sh
opam switch create 5.3.0
eval $(opam env)
opam install calendar core_unix domainslib easy_logging menhir \
  ocamlformat.0.27.0 ocamlgraph odoc ppx_deriving ppx_deriving_yojson \
  progress unionFind visitors yojson zarith
```

### 2.3 Charon + Aeneas

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AeneasVerif/aeneas.git
cd aeneas
make setup-charon   # clones + builds Charon at the commit in ./charon-pin
                    # (uses rustup; auto-installs the pinned nightly)
make                # builds Aeneas
make test           # optional: exercises the pipeline end to end
```

Do **not** hand-clone Charon next to Aeneas unless you are developing Charon
itself — `make setup-charon` owns the pin. (Charon-only work: clone it and
`make build-charon-rust`; binary lands in `bin/charon`.)

### 2.4 Smoke checklist

Prove the setup end to end; every line should succeed:

```sh
rustup show                      # pinned toolchains visible
just check                       # bridle gate green
elan --version && lean --version # elan resolves a Lean
opam --version                   # ≥ 2.1 (≥ 2.2 on native Windows)
cd aeneas && make                # Aeneas builds
./bin/aeneas --help              # translator answers
```

## 3. What this enables

With §2 green, the Ceremony Contract's proof obligations (PO-1, PO-2 first)
run as: carve the pure decision kernel in `agent-bridle-core` → Charon
extracts LLBC → Aeneas emits Lean → theorems live in a `lake` project pinned
by its `lean-toolchain`. The P1 Lean project is built on Linux and Windows in
`formal.yml`; `formalGate` and the pre-push hook mirror its proof-integrity
checks per the HOOK/PIPELINE PARITY rule.

Refs: #225 (formal-track thread), `docs/spec/ceremony-contract.md` (the
obligations this toolchain discharges).
