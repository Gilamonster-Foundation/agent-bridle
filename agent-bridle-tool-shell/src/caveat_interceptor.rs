//! [`CaveatInterceptor`] — the in-process capability hook for free-form shell.
//!
//! brush 0.5 cannot be confined in-process by a cleared `PATH` + a builtin
//! allow-list: any command whose name contains a path separator (e.g.
//! `/bin/rm`, `./payload`) bypasses both `PATH` and the builtin table and runs
//! directly (DESIGN §6). Our brush fork closes this by exposing
//! [`brush_core::extensions::CommandInterceptor`], whose `before_exec` /
//! `before_open` hooks fire at the **single external-spawn funnel** and at
//! `Shell::open_file` — so a policy applied here cannot be circumvented by
//! spelling a command (or a redirection target) differently. This makes the
//! confined shell a true superset of an `sh -c` cmd-string shell, cross-OS.
//!
//! [`CaveatInterceptor`] carries one invocation's **effective** caveats (the
//! `ToolContext` minted by the gate) and delegates every decision to the
//! *shared* leash logic on [`ToolContext`] — [`ToolContext::check_exec`],
//! [`ToolContext::check_path_read`], [`ToolContext::check_path_write`]. It does
//! **not** duplicate the canonicalizing path check; the one in
//! `agent-bridle-core` (realpath, reject symlink/`..` escapes) is the single
//! source of truth.

/// The panic payload raised to **abort a confined brush run** when its

/// return `Allow`/`Deny`, and a `Deny` is *swallowed* by the interpreter
/// (converted to a failed-command exit code — `interp.rs` catches it and the
/// enclosing `while`/`for` loop keeps running), so a returned decision can never
/// unwind a runaway loop. Unwinding is the only in-process seam that stops the
/// interpreter promptly at a command/redirect boundary, so on cancel the hook
/// raises this sentinel; [`run_in_brush`](crate::brush_shell) catches *exactly*
/// this payload and converts it to a clean cancellation error, re-raising any
/// other panic unchanged.
///
/// Reach: this stops the interpreter's OWN future. When the offending command
/// runs in a subtask — `$(...)`, `&`, a coprocess — the sentinel unwinds only to
/// that subtask's tokio boundary, where it surfaces as a `JoinError`, not to
/// `run_in_brush`'s `catch_unwind`. That is harmless for the timeout path (whose
/// worker result is discarded), but a future newt-interrupt path must not rely on
/// the sentinel propagating out of a subtask; the reliable stop there is the
/// outer wall-clock timeout, and a true subtask-level stop is Effort B (fork).
