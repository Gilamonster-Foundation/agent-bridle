//! `agent-bridle-tool-shell` — capability-confined shell tool (argv + safe-subset engine).
//!
//! Per **ADR 0005** the object-capability *boundary* is L3 (kernel) and this
//! crate is the L2 *convenience* engine: `agent-bridle` is the **exec funnel**,
//! parsing each request itself ([`crate::parse`]) and running only what it can
//! confine. [`ShellTool`] accepts either argv form (`program` + `args`) or a
//! free-form `cmd` string, checks the `exec`/`fs` leash, spawns the program
//! directly, and **refuses the dynamic constructs by design** (`$(...)`,
//! backticks, subshells — the undecidable interiors of ADR 0001). The L3
//! backstop is wired (agent-bridle#35): when it will actually confine the run —
//! today the Landlock `fs_write` axis on a capable Linux build with `fs_write`
//! restricted — children spawn inside a kernel-enforced ruleset and
//! `sandbox_kind` reports [`agent_bridle_core::SandboxKind::Landlock`]; else the
//! run is honestly *advisory* with [`agent_bridle_core::SandboxKind::None`]
//! (I9, never overclaiming). Read/exec/net axes + macOS/Windows backends are
//! follow-ups (ADR 0006).
//!
//! The engine (agent-bridle#34 Track A + #45): a sequence of pipelines joined by
//! `&&`/`||`/`;` (short-circuit semantics), each pipeline simple commands with
//! quoted arguments, **redirections** (`> out`, `>> out`, `< in`, `2> err`,
//! `2>&1`), **filename globbing** (`*`/`?`/`[…]`) and **allowlisted `$VAR`
//! expansion** — every filesystem/env touch bridle performs (redirect opens,
//! glob directory listings, variable allowlist) is leash-/policy-checked before
//! any spawn. The dynamic constructs (`$(…)`, backticks, subshells) stay refused
//! by design. The process spawning is behind a `Spawner` seam (mocked in unit
//! tests; real path in `tests/real_spawn.rs`). `brush-bridle-core` remains the
//! deferred, reversible
//! full-bash alternative engine behind the same registry seam (ADR 0005 D4 —
//! tracked on agent-bridle#20).
